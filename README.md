## ANALYSIS & INSIGHTS 

1. **Call Volume Trend:** A gradual decline in calls from January to March may indicate seasonality or reduced customer engagement.
    
2. **Customer Satisfaction:** An average rating of 3.40 indicates room for service improvement.
 
3. **Agent Performance:** Most agents have similar satisfaction scores, with no significant outliers.

4. **Call Resolution:** 73% of issues were resolved, which is positive, but the 27% unresolved rate still affects customer trust.
 
5. **Call Categories:** Streaming and technical support generate the most calls, suggesting recurring technical challenges.
  
## CONCLUSION  
The dashboard shows that while the centre is handling a large call volume, improving satisfaction and reducing unresolved issues are key priorities. 

The uniform agent ratings show balanced training but also highlight a need for standout performance.


 ## RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
  1. Investigate and address frequent streaming and technical issues to reduce repeat calls.  
 
 2. Encourage and reward high-performing agents based on customer satisfaction metrics.
 
 3. Investigate if reduced calls are due to improved services or a drop in customer engagement.
 
4. Implement **self-service options** (FAQs, chatbots, help centers) to empower customers and reduce call volume.
